NAME
    DBIx::Class::CustomPrefetch - Custom prefetches for DBIx::Class

DESCRIPTION
    DBIx::Class onle allows joins for prefetches. But sometimes you can't
    use JOIN for prefetch. E.g. for prefetching many related objects to
    resultset with paging.

    Also you can use this module to create cross-database prefetches.

    This module provides other logic for prefetching data to resultsets.

VERSION
    Version 0.09

SYNOPSIS
        package MyApp::Schema::Foo;

        __PACKAGE__->load_components( qw(Core CustomPrefetch) );
        __PACKAGE__->add_column( qw(id artist_id) );
        __PACKAGE__->resultset_class( 'DBIx::Class::ResultSet::CustomPrefetch' );
        __PACKAGE__->custom_relation( artist => sub { MyOtherResultSetClass->new } => {
            'foreign.id' => 'self.artist_id'
        });

    And your code:

        my $resultset = $schema->resultset('Foo')->search( undef, { rows => 10 } );
        foreach ($resultset->all) {
            say $_->artist->name;
        }

    will make only two SQL requests:

        SELECT id, artist_id FROM foo LIMIT 10;
        SELECT * FROM artists WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89);

METHODS
  custom_relation
    Makes IN relation. In can be has_one, might_have or many_to_many

    Args: $relation_name, $resultset_callback, $condition
